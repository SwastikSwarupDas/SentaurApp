## About The Project

Sentaur is a web-based application that will be used by people interested in using sentiment analysis to determine motivations and purpose of chat participants. The application will be most useful for the deployment of advertisement personalization within applications with real-time analysis of sentiments and user-needs.

Messaging or chat applications have become an important part of our daily lives. But there is still a need for additional features and functionalities. This project aims to fill this gap by providing a chat application along with sentiment analysis to provide users with information about emotions conveyed in their messages. The chat application that we have developed has been named ‚ÄúSentaur‚Äù.

Analysis the texts and assigning a sentiment score to each text will help users understand the tone of the conversation and will help them convey their messages more effectively.

The MERN stack which is used to develop this application is ideal for building modern web applications, Socket.io is used for real time, bidirectional communication between the users, while Python libraries such as NLTK can provide useful tools for performing sentiment analysis on texts. The integration of these technologies provides a comprehensive solution for developing a chat application with sentiment analysis.
